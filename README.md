# Cab-Booking-System
 
The **Cab Booking System** is a comprehensive application developed in Java that facilitates the booking of cabs for intracity travel. This system offers users an efficient and user-friendly platform to reserve cabs according to their preferences. Built with a graphical user interface using the Swing framework, the application enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing and intuitive interface.

#### Key Features:

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Users can create an account and log in to access the cab booking features.
   - Secure user authentication ensures that personal information is protected.

2. **Booking Cabs**:
   - Users can choose their source and destination from a predefined list.
   - The system displays available cab options along with driver details, car types, and pricing.
   - Users can book a cab by confirming their selection, generating a unique reference number for each booking.

3. **Viewing Booking Details**:
   - After booking, users can view the details of their reservations, including driver name, car type, route, and fare.
   - The system allows users to retrieve their booking information using their username.

4. **Database Management**:
   - The application employs JDBC to interact with a MySQL database, where user information and booking details are securely stored.
   - The system uses SQL queries to perform CRUD operations efficiently.

#### Technologies Used:

- **Java**: The primary programming language for developing the application.
- **Swing**: A GUI toolkit for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **JDBC**: For connecting to the MySQL database and executing SQL queries.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store user and cab booking data.

#### Benefits:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Swing-based GUI is designed for easy navigation, making it simple for users to book cabs without extensive technical knowledge.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Users can see available cabs based on their input, ensuring they have options that suit their needs.
- **Secure Data Handling**: The system prioritizes user data security by implementing secure login and data storage practices.

#### Conclusion:

The Cab Booking System serves as an excellent example of integrating Java application development with database management. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, GUI design, and the importance of user experience in software applications. This project not only enhances technical skills but also provides a practical solution for everyday travel needs.
